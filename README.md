# Blank Jekyll Templated Theme

This is a combination of two projects:

 - The [blank jekyll theme](https://github.com/garrettboatman/Blank-Theme-Jekyll) by
   [garrettboatman](https://github.com/garrettboatman)

 - The [Ion](http://templated.co/ion) [Templated](http://templated.co/) theme

Thanks to both - all I have really done here is cut and paste. My aim is to come up with a Jekyll
template that allows you to switch the css from different Templated templates. I haven't actually
tried to replace the Ion css though, so don't know if this will work!
